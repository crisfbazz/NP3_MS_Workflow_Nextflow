## Installation NP続 MS Workflow with Nextflow

You will need to have conda and mamba installed to run things locally. 

Create the np3_nextflow environment stored in: bin/environment_np3_nextflow_unix.yml

```
mamba env create -f bin/environment_np3_nextflow_unix.yml 
```

And activate the np3_nextflow environment:

```
mamba activate np3_nextflow 
```

Then, install some additional nodejs packages: 

```
npm install shelljs@0.8.4 commander@5.1.0 
```

Finally, go to the 'bin/NP3_MS_Workflow' directory and run the NP続 MS Workflow setup (check installed packages, compile some code, aggregate some data from UNPD and download large data from spec2vec):

```
node np3_workflow.js setup 
```

You are good to go!
